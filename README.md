### Project Idea

Do you want to boost your productivity and agility of your development? With Ryoko you are able to
effectively plan your tasks and manage your projects. It is build with developers in mind and
facilitates effective collaboration.

## Getting Started

The source code for the repository is split into two parts. The backend code can be found inside the
`server` directory while the frontend code can be found inside the `client` directory. Both parts
are managed using the `yarn` package manager, but can also be used with `npm` if necessary. The
server and client parts also use the same commands for running building and testing.

### How to Run

To start a development server you can execute `yarn start` (or `npm run start`) inside the `server`
and the `client` directories. Most parts of the client will also require the server to be running
simultaneously.

### How to Build

To build a production build enter the respective directory (either `server` or `client`) and execute
`yarn build` (or `npm run build`). The build output will be created inside a directory named `build`
and can then be executed using node for the server, or served staticaly for the client.

### How to Use

After starting the development server inside `client`, the website is accessible at
`http://localhost:3000`. Depending on your configuration the site will probably be opened
automatically in your default browser after execution of `yarn start`.
