## Who?: Target group

Ryoko is mostly designed for companies or hobby-groups who focus on software engineering. Yet it can
also be used by small and medium sized companies from other sectors.

## What?: Behavior

The purpose of the web application is to simplify planning processes within teams and companies.
Teams can plan their tasks by creating them within projects and assign them to either specific users
or general user groups (roles). If tasks are assigned to specific users, they are shown on the tasks
page of the application ordered by their priority. On the other hand, if the task was assigned to a
role, it will be shown on the tasks page as a recommended task, which the user can claim by
assigning themselves to the task. One such task can be started and the time spent on the task is
tracked directly by the system.

## Why?: Benefits

By harnessing the power of creating only requirements for tasks, ryoko is able to suggest the task
to team members who fit its requirements automatically. Due to that it provides an automatic
distribution of tasks and lowers many hurdles of project management. On the tasks page of the
application, team members can choose the task they want to do, therefore, they can choose the
process based on their preferences, yet shows more important tasks above less important tasks. the
In addition to that users can keep track of their time spent on each process and on how much time is
left for one task.
